🚀 A Complete Step-by-Step Learning Journey

This repository is my personal day-by-day learning project while studying Machine Learning using Python. I created this repo to document my full learning process with proper explanations, examples, and visual outputs — so that both I and others can learn from it anytime in the future.

Each notebook includes clear topic-wise lessons, well-commented code, and real dataset examples to make learning easier and more practical. It’s designed for beginners to intermediate learners who want to understand ML from scratch through code and logic.

🌟 Features

📘 Day-by-day structured ML learning journey

💡 Step-by-step explanations and examples

🧩 Hands-on code implementations in Python

📊 Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn

🤖 Machine Learning algorithms with Scikit-learn

🔁 Continuous progress tracking and updates

🧠 Covers key topics: preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation

🧰 Prerequisites

Before using the files, make sure you have:

Python 3.8+ installed

Basic Python programming knowledge

Required libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com//Python-With-Machine-Learning.git

Navigate to the project folder

cd Python-With-Machine-Learning

Open files in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (Recommended: Jupyter Notebook for easy visualization)

🧑‍💻 Usage

Open any .ipynb file (example: Day03_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb).

Read the explanations and execute cells step-by-step.

Observe outputs, graphs, and results.

Modify code to experiment with your own datasets.

🧾 Sample Output

Example Console Output:

Training Accuracy: 0.95 Testing Accuracy: 0.92 Model: Logistic Regression

Visualization Output:

Accuracy graph

Confusion matrix

Scatter plots and regression lines

🧮 JSON Output Format

Some scripts save model performance or predictions in JSON format for easy reuse:

{ "model": "DecisionTreeClassifier", "training_accuracy": 0.94, "testing_accuracy": 0.91, "parameters": { "criterion": "gini", "max_depth": 5 } }

All JSON outputs are stored in the /outputs folder.

⚙️ How It Works

Each file covers one ML concept per day.

Data is preprocessed, visualized, then modeled.

Trained models are evaluated for performance.

Optional: JSON files store model metrics for analysis.

Code is modular and easy to reuse in other projects.

🧰 Error Handling

Each notebook includes try-except blocks to handle:

File loading errors (FileNotFoundError)

Invalid data types (ValueError)

Missing values and preprocessing issues

Model training failures due to incorrect input shape

Example:

try: data = pd.read_csv("datasets/sample_data.csv") except FileNotFoundError: print("Error: Dataset not found. Please check the path.")

⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions Issue Possible Cause Solution ModuleNotFoundError Library not installed Run pip install FileNotFoundError Wrong dataset path Use correct relative path ValueError: could not convert Wrong data type Clean or convert data before model training Notebook not running Kernel issue Restart Jupyter kernel or VS Code interpreter 🧾 Version History & Support Version Date Description v1.0 Oct 2025 Initial release with Day 1–5 notebooks v1.1 Nov 2025 Added JSON output and visualization updates v1.2 Dec 2025 Improved structure, added error handling and examples
