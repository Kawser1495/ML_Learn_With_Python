🚀 Python With Machine Learning — A Complete Step-by-Step Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal day-by-day learning journey in Machine Learning using Python.
I built it to track my own progress and help others learn ML from scratch through clear explanations, hands-on examples, and visual results.

Each notebook is self-contained with detailed notes, well-commented code, and real datasets, making it easy to follow for beginners and intermediate learners alike.

🌟 Key Features

📘 Day-by-day structured ML learning path

💡 Step-by-step explanations with code and visual examples

🧩 Hands-on implementations using Python

📊 Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

🤖 ML algorithms built using Scikit-learn

🔁 Continuous updates and learning logs

🧠 Covers essentials: preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation


🧰 Prerequisites

Before using the files, make sure you have:

Python 3.8+ installed

Basic Python programming knowledge

Required libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com//Python-With-Machine-Learning.git

Navigate to the project folder

cd Python-With-Machine-Learning

Open files in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (Recommended: Jupyter Notebook for easy visualization)


🧑‍💻 Usage
Open any .ipynb file (for example: Day03_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb).

Read the explanations and run the cells step-by-step.

Observe the outputs, graphs, and results.

Modify the code to experiment with your own datasets.

🧾 Sample Output

Example Console Output:

Training Accuracy: 0.95 Testing Accuracy: 0.92 Model: Logistic Regression

Visualization Output:

Accuracy graph

Confusion matrix

Scatter plots and regression lines

🧮 JSON Output Format

Some scripts save model performance or predictions in JSON format for easy reuse:

{ "model": "DecisionTreeClassifier", "training_accuracy": 0.94, "testing_accuracy": 0.91, "parameters": { "criterion": "gini", "max_depth": 5 } }

All JSON outputs are stored in the /outputs folder.

⚙️ How It Works

Each file covers one ML concept per day.

Data is preprocessed, visualized, then modeled.

Trained models are evaluated for performance.

Optional: JSON files store model metrics for analysis.

Code is modular and easy to reuse in other projects.

| Error Type            | Cause                 | Solution                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Library not installed | Run `pip install <library>`                   |
| `FileNotFoundError`   | Wrong dataset path    | Use correct relative path                     |
| `ValueError`          | Invalid data type     | Clean or convert data before training         |
| Notebook not running  | Kernel issue          | Restart Jupyter kernel or VS Code interpreter |


Example:

try: data = pd.read_csv("datasets/sample_data.csv") except FileNotFoundError: print("Error: Dataset not found. Please check the path.")
