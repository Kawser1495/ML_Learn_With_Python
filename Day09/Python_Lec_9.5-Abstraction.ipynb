    "#### Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction in Python is about hiding the internal details of how something works and showing only what’s necessary to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like driving a car — you just use the steering, pedals, and buttons without worrying about how the engine actually functions inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Why abstraction matters\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduce complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep your code secure and clean.\n",

    "🔹 How it works in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports abstraction mainly through abstract classes and abstract methods using the abc (Abstract Base Class) module."
