    "#### Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction in Python is about hiding the internal details of how something works and showing only what’s necessary to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like driving a car — you just use the steering, pedals, and buttons without worrying about how the engine actually functions inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Why abstraction matters\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduce complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep your code secure and clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 How it works in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports abstraction mainly through abstract classes and abstract methods using the abc (Abstract Base Class) module."

    "\n",
    "1. Hides complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "* You don’t need to know every internal step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You just use the function or class interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: You call .start() on a Car object without worrying about how fuel ignition works.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increases security\n",
    "\n",
    "* By hiding sensitive details (like private variables or complex logic), abstraction prevents direct access or misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improves code readability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code is easier to understand because users see only the high-level functions — not the internal mess.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Easier maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "* When internal logic changes, the outer interface can stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "* That means less refactoring and fewer bugs when updating features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Supports reusability and scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can design general abstract classes (like Vehicle, Payment, or Shape) and reuse them for many specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Encourages modular design\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each class focuses on one clear purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Developers can work independently on different modules without breaking others."
